## DISCPLAIMER
The purpose of this project is educational and should under no circustances be taken as a real life news outlet regardless if the json data we receive from the API are real news.

#### Objectives of Project

Within this project I wanted to bring together various aspects of React arhitecture. Such as statefull/stateless components, useFetch get calls, clearer component and state managment system alongside using styled-components.

#### Difficulties that I phased

Even though the idea/concept of the project is relativly simple I really struggled quite a lot to figure out the nested complexity of each parent component. This project taught me that I need to more seriously look into better ways to structure my components and the passing states. Moreover this was the first trully start to finish concept of a project that invloved more nested features, something that I hadn't done before. This taught me to be more deligent with naming components, classes etc and think through more carefully each change.

#### Thing to improve

Better github set up - learn when to commint
Better compoenent/state structure
